# utility-scripts
Small, useful helper scripts that I've gotten tired of rewriting every time I need them.

rand.sh - Outputs random numbers. Uses od and urandom. Usage is `sh rand.sh min max` or just `sh rand.sh max`.

math.sh - Outputs result of mathematical equation. Uses bc. Usage is `sh math.sh "equation" decimals` 

shell.sh - A boiler-plate script that has code for requiring root and handling parameters. (Doesn't actually work at the moment...)
